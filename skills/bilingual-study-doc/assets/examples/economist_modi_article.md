# 📰 The Odd Thing About Modi's Mojo
# 莫迪魔力的奇特之处

**Leaders | 社论**  
*Constraints make India's prime minister govern better*  
*约束反而让印度总理执政得更好*

📅 January 22nd, 2026

Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, was humbled in 2024. His party lost its national majority and had to start ruling in coalition. Policymaking looked listless for most of the next 12 months. Some thought the re-election of Donald Trump, with whom Mr Modi once got on famously, would strengthen his hand. Instead America's president whacked most Indian exports with tariffs, which now add up to 50%.

> 印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪在2024年遭受了挫折。他的政党失去了全国多数席位，不得不开始组建联合政府执政。在随后的大部分12个月里，政策制定显得萎靡不振。有人认为唐纳德·特朗普的再次当选会增强莫迪的筹码——毕竟两人曾经相处甚欢。然而，这位美国总统却对大多数印度出口商品征收关税，累计已达50%。

Yet adversity, and the need to satisfy his coalition partners, seem to have made Mr Modi more pragmatic. Though he still indulges in divisive rhetoric, he has taken fewer actions to goad or bully India's Muslims since his electoral setback. Instead, he has concentrated on economic reforms, which should help the country maintain its zippy growth rate. If he keeps that up, Indians will benefit hugely.

> 然而，逆境以及满足联盟伙伴需求的压力，似乎让莫迪变得更加务实。虽然他仍然沉溺于分裂性言论，但自从选举挫败以来，他采取的刺激或欺压印度穆斯林的行动已经减少。相反，他把精力集中在经济改革上，这应该有助于该国保持其活跃的增长率。如果他能坚持下去，印度人民将受益匪浅。

The government expects India's economy to expand by 7.4% in the fiscal year that will end in March. It may soon be bigger than Japan's and could overtake Germany's by 2028. A decade-long effort to promote manufacturing is starting to show some results, despite American tariffs: India now assembles about a fifth of the world's iPhones.

> 政府预计印度经济在截至3月的财政年度将增长7.4%。它可能很快将超过日本，并可能在2028年前超越德国。尽管面临美国关税，长达十年的制造业促进努力开始显现成效：印度现在组装了全球约五分之一的iPhone。

Mr Modi seems to recognise that keeping growth high will require more work. In the past few months his government has unveiled bankruptcy reforms, which should shorten drawn-out disputes, and simplifications to India's bewildering national value-added tax, under which a bag of popcorn could attract one of three different rates. Officials have promised to cut the red tape that makes it so easy for corrupt inspectors to extort bribes to turn a blind eye, such as criminal penalties for a tiny misstatement of the weight of a packet of biscuits.

> 莫迪似乎认识到，保持高增长需要付出更多努力。在过去几个月里，他的政府公布了破产改革措施，这应该会缩短旷日持久的争端，并简化印度令人困惑的全国增值税——在该税制下，一袋爆米花可能适用三种不同税率中的任何一种。官员们承诺将削减繁文缛节，正是这些繁文缛节让腐败的检查员很容易敲诈勒索以便睁一只眼闭一只眼，比如对一包饼干重量的微小误报就可能面临刑事处罚。

In November came helpful changes to labour laws, tidying up a mess of rules that have long given Indian companies perverse incentives to stay small. The government is working on a bill that could encourage private firms to fix rusty pylons and decrepit substations, thereby cutting the price of power.

> 11月，劳动法迎来了有益的修改，整理了长期以来给印度公司提供扭曲激励、促使它们保持小规模的一团乱麻般的规则。政府正在制定一项法案，可能会鼓励私营企业修复生锈的电线杆和破旧的变电站，从而降低电价。

---

On the international front, India has closed three trade agreements since the middle of last year: with Britain, New Zealand and Oman. It may soon announce a big new trade deal with the European Union. It is about to open trade talks with Canada. It says it will let foreign firms compete more freely in insurance and nuclear power.

> 在国际方面，自去年年中以来，印度已签订了三项贸易协定：分别与英国、新西兰和阿曼。它可能很快将宣布与欧盟达成一项重大新贸易协议。它即将与加拿大开启贸易谈判。它表示将允许外国公司在保险和核电领域更自由地竞争。

---

Finally, India is patching up its economic ties with its giant neighbour. Relations with China froze in 2020 after Himalayan border clashes in which soldiers were beaten to death or drowned in a river. But last year Mr Modi met Xi Jinping in China—his first visit there for seven years. Direct flights between the two countries restarted in October, after half a decade's pause.

> 最后，印度正在修补与其巨大邻国的经济关系。2020年，在喜马拉雅边境冲突中有士兵被打死或溺亡于河中之后，印中关系冻结。但去年莫迪在中国会见了习近平——这是他七年来首次访华。两国之间的直航在暂停五年后于10月重新恢复。

---

For years India barred much Chinese investment, and made it hard for Chinese executives to get visas. Conscious that it needs Chinese cash and know-how, it is beginning to ease back on such excessive restrictions.

> 多年来，印度阻止了大量中国投资，并使中国高管难以获得签证。意识到自己需要中国的资金和技术，它开始放松这些过度的限制。

---

Will Mr Modi continue in this welcome direction? Thumping victories in recent state elections have restored some of his party's swagger. And the outside world is looking less hostile. Not only has there been a thaw with China; Mr Trump's fury with India has eased since it cut back on purchases of Russian oil. The danger is that Mr Modi's appetite for reforms may go soft, if they can no longer be sold to his nationalist supporters as a necessary sacrifice to strengthen India in an unfriendly world.

> 莫迪会继续朝这个令人欣慰的方向前进吗？最近邦选举中的大胜已经恢复了他政党的一些趾高气扬。外部世界看起来也不那么充满敌意了。不仅与中国关系解冻；自从印度减少购买俄罗斯石油以来，特朗普对印度的愤怒也有所缓和。危险在于，如果改革不能再以"在不友好的世界中加强印度的必要牺牲"为由向其民族主义支持者兜售，莫迪对改革的胃口可能会减弱。

The recent reforms are not enough. Some merely correct recent errors. Although India's average tariff rate is drifting down, it is still higher than it was when Mr Modi first won power in 2014. Much-needed reforms to agriculture are still locked in a box marked "too hard". So are changes to make it easier for companies to acquire land. India's awful schools continue to waste hundreds of millions of young minds. Smog and traffic jams steal some of the boost India could gain from urbanisation. Unforced errors remain common: this month India's Supreme Court alarmed foreign investors with a ruling that has thrown into confusion what tax they must pay on capital gains. And Mr Modi has not lost his authoritarian instincts, even if he has curbed them somewhat.

> 最近的改革还不够。有些只是纠正了近期的错误。尽管印度的平均关税率正在下降，但仍高于2014年莫迪首次执政时的水平。急需的农业改革仍被锁在标着"太难"的盒子里。让企业更容易获取土地的改革也是如此。印度糟糕的学校继续浪费着数亿年轻人的头脑。雾霾和交通拥堵偷走了印度本可从城市化中获得的一些红利。非受迫性失误仍然常见：本月，印度最高法院的一项裁决令外国投资者惊慌失措，该裁决使他们必须为资本利得支付多少税款陷入混乱。即使莫迪有所收敛，他也没有失去其威权本能。

---

Yet as America grows increasingly protectionist and erratic, India's reformist turn deserves praise. Mr Modi could have responded to his setback at the ballot box, or to Mr Trump's tariffs, in a much less constructive manner. Indians seem to have recognised that building a whizzier economy is the best way to gain global clout. Mr Modi should double down on economic pragmatism, and keep his divisive impulses in check. ■

> 然而，随着美国变得越来越保护主义和反复无常，印度的改革转向值得赞扬。莫迪本可以用一种远不那么建设性的方式来回应他在投票箱前的挫败，或回应特朗普的关税。印度人似乎已经认识到，建设一个更有活力的经济是获得全球影响力的最佳途径。莫迪应该在经济务实主义上加倍努力，并控制住他的分裂冲动。■
